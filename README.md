The Dragon Ball Z: Legendary Super Warriors Randomizer can change nearly everything in the game!
For example: Stats, Enemies, Rewards, Sprites, Color-palettes and more 

Features:
- In the following I will break down every other Feature and Setting in the Tool!

Basic Features:
- The cutscenes run automatically (faster with pressing A a few times in the beginning) and it is not necessary to press A at every single line of dialogue... So much dialogue...
- The battle mode is enabled from the beginning

Random Rewards:
- The Rewards after a story battle, cards on the map and the cards you get when unlocking a new character are all randomized 
- Every Card is possible
- Map and character unlock cards have the wrong name in the chatbox

Shuffle Enemies:
- The enemy (so deck and limits) get shuffled
- 1 V 1 enemies shuffle with 1 V 1 enemies and 2 V 2 enemies with 2 V 2 enemies
- In the pool is every opponent from the two round of story modes and the batte mode

Shuffle Battle Mode Tiers:
- Shuffles the battle tiers of the different characters 
- The amount of opponents per tier stays the same

Add Limits:
- The enemies got two more limit cards
- The cards are random and can be anyone
- That makes predicting what the enemy can do more difficult

Stat Change Characters:
- The start stats of the characters are randomized
- The stat gain per level up (star) are randomized
- The later enemies (even when shuffled) are also having stars, making their stats more unpredictable!

Stat Change Cards:
- The Power, Acc and Cost of card can be 50% to 150% of the original value
- This changes also affect the enemies

Add Move Usability:
- Every character has a 50% chance for every card to be able to use that card
- This does not affect cards that the character can normaly use

Disguised Characters:
- The sprites of the characters and forms are shuffled. So Kid Gohan might look like Goku and Kid Gohan SSJ 1 like Ginyu
- Together with shuffled enemies it is very hard to guess the enemy and perfect deck doing the first fight
- The Names in the combat chatbox are greyed out

Palette Shuffles Characters / Stages
- The palettes of the characters / stages get shuffled
- This can bring out some weird looking stuff
